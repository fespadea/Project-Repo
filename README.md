# Matrix Sparsification

The code run for our project can be found in the 3 Jupyter notebooks: MatrixSparsificationExperiments.ipynb, figure1-2.ipynb, and figure3.ipynb

The data used for our code is also present in the repo. The MNIST handwritten digit data is in the handdrawnDigits folder. 
The license plate images are in the LicensePlates folder, and the football data is in footballScores.csv. The code will also download the MNIST 
handwritten digit data if it isn't present, but the other two datasets do need to be present already.

Our report is found in Report.pdf, and our initial draft of the progress report can be found in ProgressReport.pdf.

Our pdf slide deck is the Presentation.pdf file, and our presentation video can be seen here: https://rpi.box.com/s/favphdrnhykhm57kmv4dkyf0nhnkee2v
